# Sample E-Commerce Website

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

A mini E-commerce project provided by Bob Ziroll from VSchool, this taught me to use many of React's hooks like useContext and useRef, more in depth.

## What it does

Similar to other e-commerce websites, you can favorite items, and also add them to a cart.
of course, the checkout process is merely a dummy.

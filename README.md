# Sample E-Commerce Website

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

A mini E-commerce project. This taught me to get more familiar with many of React's hooks like useContext and useRef, more in depth.
It helped me gain more confidence in understanding state (and managing state)!

## What it does

Similar to other e-commerce websites, you can favorite items, and also add them to a cart.
of course, the checkout process is merely a dummy.
